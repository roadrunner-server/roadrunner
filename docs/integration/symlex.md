Simply delete what you don't need.
Since its initial release in 2014, it has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI and single-page applications. It comes complete with working examples from testing to forms and database abstraction. 

As published by [phpbenchmarks.com](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com/en/benchmark/symlex/4.1), REST requests are more than 40% faster compared to other common PHP frameworks.
