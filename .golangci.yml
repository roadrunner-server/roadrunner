  enable:
    - asciicheck # Simple linter to check that your code does not contain non-ASCII identifiers
    - bodyclose # Checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - deadcode # Finds unused code
    - depguard # Go linter that checks if package imports are in a list of acceptable packages
    - dogsled # Checks assignments with too many blank identifiers (e.g. x, _, _, _, := f())
    - errcheck # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
    - exhaustive # check exhaustiveness of enum switch statements
    - exportloopref # checks for pointers to enclosing loop variables
    - gochecknoinits # Checks that no init functions are present in Go code
    - gocognit # Computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions
    - goconst # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
    - gocritic # The most opinionated Go source code linter
    - gofmt # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification
    - goimports # Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports
    - golint # Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes
    - goprintffuncname # Checks that printf-like functions are named with `f` at the end
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - misspell # Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments
    - nakedret # Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
    - noctx # finds sending http request without context.Context
    - nolintlint # Reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
    - prealloc # Finds slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated
    - rowserrcheck # Checks whether Err of rows is checked successfully
    - staticcheck # Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - structcheck # Finds unused struct fields
    - stylecheck # Stylecheck is a replacement for golint
    - tparallel # detects inappropriate usage of t.Parallel() method in your Go test codes
    - typecheck # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unconvert # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types
    - varcheck # Finds unused global variables and constants
    - whitespace # Tool for detection of leading and trailing whitespace
