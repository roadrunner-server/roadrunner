## v2.7.2 (17.01.2022)

## üëÄ New:
- Moved to the new organization.

---

## v2.7.0 (14.01.2022)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è RR `workers pool`, `worker`, `worker_watcher` now has their own log levels. `stderr/stdout` logged as before at the `info` log level. All other messages moved to the `debug` log level except a few events from the `worker_watcher` when RR can't allocate the new worker which are moved to the `warn`.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Use the common logger for the whole roadrunner-sdk and roadrunner-plugins.
- ‚úèÔ∏è `.rr.yaml` now support versions. You may safely use your old configurations w/o specifying versions. Configuration w/o version will be treated as `2.6`. It is safe to use configuration w/o version or with version `2.6` with RR `2.7` because RR is able to automatically transform the old configuration.
  But if you use configuration version `2.7` you must update the `jobs` pipelines config.
  **At this point we can guarantee, that no breaking changes will be introduced in the configuration w/o auto-convert from the older configuration version**
  For example, if we introduce a configuration update let's say in version `2.10`, we will support automatic conversion from at least 2 previous versions w/o involving the user into the process. In the example case, versions `2.9` and `2.8` will be automatically converted. From our release cycle, you will have at least 3 months to update the configuration from version `2.8` and 2 months from `2.9`.Version located at the top of the `.rr.yaml`:

**Compatibility matrix located here**: TODO
**Configuration changelog**: TODO

```yaml
version: "2.6"

# ..... PLUGINS ......

**Before:**
```yaml
  pipelines:
    test-local:
      driver: memory
      priority: 10
      prefetch: 10000

    test-local-1:

```

**After**:
Now, pipelines have only `driver` key with the configuration under the `config` key. We did that to uniform configuration across all drivers (like in the `KV`).
```yaml
  pipelines:
    test-local:
      driver: memory

      config: # <------------------ NEW
        priority: 10

```

- ‚úèÔ∏è **[ALPHA]** New cache http middleware. It is still in alpha, but we started implementing the [rfc-7234](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) to support `Cache-Control` and caching in general. In the first alpha you may test the `max-age`, `Age` and `Authorization` support via the in-memory driver.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
http:
# .....
    middleware: ["cache"]
    cache:
        driver: memory
        cache_methods: ["GET", "HEAD", "POST"] # only GET in alpha
        config: {} # empty configuration for the memory
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Logger unification. Starting this version we bound our logs to the `uber/zap` log library as one of the most popular and extensible.
- ‚úèÔ∏è API stabilization. All `v2` api interfaces moved to the `https://github.com/roadrunner-server/api` repository. Except logger (structure), all plugins depends only on the interfaces and don't import each other.
- ‚úèÔ∏è `GRPC` plugin now is able to work with gzipped payloads. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/191) (reporter @hetao29)
- ‚úèÔ∏è `SQS` plugin now detects EC2 env and uses AWS credentials instead of static provider. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/142) (reporter @paulermo)
- ‚úèÔ∏è `Jobs` plugin now acknowledges responses with incorrectly formed responses to prevent the infinity loop (with the error message in the logs). [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/190) (reporter @sergey-telpuk)
- ‚úèÔ∏è `protoc` updated to the version `v3.19.2`.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: RR may have missed the message from the `stderr` when the PHP script failed to start immediately after RR starts.
- üêõ Fix: 200 HTTP status code instead of 400 on readiness/health bad requests. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/180)
- üêõ Fix: `new_relic` plugin removes/modifies more headers than it should. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/185) (reporter: @arku31)


## v2.6.6 (7.12.2021)

## üëÄ New:

- ‚úèÔ∏è Add events from the supervisor to the `server` plugin.
-
## ü©π Fixes:
- üêõ Fix: worker exited immediately after obtaining the response. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/issues/871) (reporter: @samdark).

## üì¶ Packages:

- üì¶ Update RoadRunner to `v2.6.2`

## v2.6.5 (7.12.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:
- üêõ Fix: wrong metrics type for the `rr_http_requests_queue`, [bug](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/162) (reporter: @victor-sudakov)
- üêõ Fix: memory leak when supervised static pool used. [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/pull/870).

## üì¶ Packages:

## ü©π Fixes:
- üêõ Fix: NPE in the `http.Reset`. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/155)

---

## v2.6.3 (3.12.2021)

## üëÄ New:
- ‚úèÔ∏è `informer.List` RPC call return all available plugins with workers instead of all available plugins. This behavior was changed because `Informer` has the dependency of every RR plugin, which led to the cycles. This is not an external API and used only internally.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Beanstalk queue returned to the **[ALPHA]** stage. It's very unstable when destroying pipelines and can lead to infinite read loops when something wrong with the connection. Use with care.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Go version updated to `v1.17.4`.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: add missing plugins to the container: `fileserver`, `http_metrics`.
---

## v2.6.2 (3.12.2021)

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: Random NPE on RR start. [BUG](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/143)

---

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: logger incorrectly escaped HTML, JSON, and other special symbols.

---

## v2.6.0 (30.11.2021)

## üëÄ New:
- ‚úèÔ∏è New internal message bus. Available globally. Supports wildcard subscriptions (for example: `http.*` will subscribe you to the all events coming from the `http` plugin). The subscriptions can be made from any RR plugin to any RR plugin.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Now, RR will show in the returned error the bad header content in case of CRC mismatch error. More info in the [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner/pull/863).
- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** Support for the New Relic observability platform. Sample of the client library might be
  found [here](https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic). (Thanks @arku31)
  New Relic middleware is a part of the HTTP plugin, thus configuration should be inside it:

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "new_relic" ] <------- NEW
  new_relic: <---------- NEW
    app_name: "app"
    license_key: "key"
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

License key and application name could be set via environment variables: (leave `app_name` and `license_key` empty)

- license_key: `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`.
- app_name: `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`.

To set the New Relic attributes, the PHP worker should send headers values withing the `rr_newrelic` header key.
Attributes should be separated by the `:`, for example `foo:bar`, where `foo` is a key and `bar` is a value. New Relic
attributes sent from the worker will not appear in the HTTP response, they will be sent directly to the New Relic.

To see the sample of the PHP library, see the @arku31 implementation: https://github.com/arku31/roadrunner-newrelic

The special key which PHP may set to overwrite the transaction name is: `transaction_name`. For
example: `transaction_name:foo` means: set transaction name as `foo`. By default, `RequestURI` is used as the
transaction name.

```php
        $resp = new \Nyholm\Psr7\Response();
        $rrNewRelic = [
            'shopId:1', //custom data
            'auth:password', //custom data
            'transaction_name:test_transaction' //name - special key to override the name. By default it will use requestUri.
        ];

        $resp = $resp->withHeader('rr_newrelic', $rrNewRelic);
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** New plugin: `TCP`. The TCP plugin is used to handle raw TCP payload with a bi-directional [protocol](tcp/docs/tcp.md) between the RR server and PHP worker.

PHP client library: https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-tcp

Configuration:
```yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php ../../psr-worker-tcp-cont.php"

tcp:
  servers:
    server1:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:7778
      delimiter: "\r\n"
    server2:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8811
      read_buf_size: 10
    server3:
      addr: 127.0.0.1:8812
      delimiter: "\r\n"
      read_buf_size: 1

  pool:
    num_workers: 5
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è New HTTP middleware: `http_metrics`.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:15389
  middleware: [ "http_metrics" ] <------- NEW
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```
All old and new http metrics will be available after the middleware is activated. Be careful, this middleware may slow down your requests. New metrics:

    - `rr_http_requests_queue_sum` - number of queued requests.
    - `rr_http_no_free_workers_total` - number of the occurrences of the `NoFreeWorkers` errors.


-----

- ‚úèÔ∏è New file server to serve static files. It works on a different address, so it doesn't affect the HTTP performance. It uses advanced configuration specific for the static file servers. It can handle any number of directories with its own HTTP prefixes.
  Config:

```yaml
fileserver:
  # File server address
  #
  # Error on empty
  address: 127.0.0.1:10101
  # Etag calculation. Request body CRC32.
  #
  # Default: false
  calculate_etag: true

  # Weak etag calculation
  #
  # Default: false
  weak: false

  # Enable body streaming for the files more than 4KB
  #
  # Default: false
  stream_request_body: true

  serve:
    # HTTP prefix
    #
    # Error on empty
  - prefix: "/foo"

    # Directory to serve
    #
    # Default: "."
    root: "../../../tests"

    # When set to true, the server tries minimizing CPU usage by caching compressed files
    #
    # Default: false
    compress: false

    # Expiration duration for inactive file handlers. Units: seconds.
    #
    # Default: 10, use a negative value to disable it.
    cache_duration: 10

    # The value for the Cache-Control HTTP-header. Units: seconds
    #
    # Default: 10 seconds
    max_age: 10

    # Enable range requests
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests
    #
    # Default: false
    bytes_range: true

  - prefix: "/foo/bar"
    root: "../../../tests"
    compress: false
    cache_duration: 10s
    max_age: 10
    bytes_range: true
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è `on_init` option for the `server` plugin. `on_init` code executed before the regular command and can be used to warm up the application for example. Failed `on_init` command doesn't affect the main command, so, the RR will continue to run. Thanks (@OO00O0O)

Config:
```yaml
# Application server settings (docs: https://roadrunner.dev/docs/php-worker)
server:
  on_init: <----------- NEW
    # Command to execute before the main server's command
    #
    # This option is required if using on_init
    command: "any php or script here"

    # Script execute timeout
    #
    # Default: 60s [60m, 60h], if used w/o units its means - NANOSECONDS.
    exec_timeout: 20s

    # Environment variables for the worker processes.
    #
    # Default: <empty map>
    env:
      - SOME_KEY: "SOME_VALUE"
      - SOME_KEY2: "SOME_VALUE2"

  # ..REGULAR SERVER OPTIONS...
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è **[BETA]** GRPC can handle multiply proto files.
  Config:
```yaml
# GRPC service configuration
grpc:
    # Proto files to use
    #
    # This option is required. At least one proto file must be specified.
    proto:
        - "first.proto"
        - "second.proto"

## ... OTHER REGULAR GRPC OPTIONS ...
```

---

- ‚úèÔ∏è New `allow` configuration option for the `http.uploads` and multipart requests. The new option allows you to filter upload extensions knowing only allowed. Now, there is no need to have a looong list with all possible extensions to forbid. [FR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/123) (Thanks @rjd22)
  `http.uploads.forbid` has a higher priority, so, if you have duplicates in the `http.uploads.allow` and `http.uploads.forbid` the duplicated extension will be forbidden.
  Config:

```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:18903
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: ["pluginMiddleware", "pluginMiddleware2"]
  uploads:
    forbid: [".php", ".exe", ".bat"]
    allow: [".html", ".aaa" ] <------------- NEW
  trusted_subnets:
    [
      "10.0.0.0/8",
      "127.0.0.0/8",
      "172.16.0.0/12",
      "192.168.0.0/16",
      "::1/128",
      "fc00::/7",
      "fe80::/10",
    ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Beanstalk queue reject stop RPC calls if there are jobs in the priority queue associated with the requested
  pipeline.

- ‚úèÔ∏è Startup message when the RR has started.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: GRPC server will show message when started.

## v2.5.0 (20.10.2021)

# üíî Breaking change:

- üî® Some drivers now use a new `config` key to handle local configuration. Involved plugins and drivers:
- `plugins`: `broadcast`, `kv`
- `drivers`: `memory`, `redis`, `memcached`, `boltdb`.

### Old style:

```yaml
broadcast:
    default:
        driver: memory
        interval: 1
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Add a new option to the `logs` plugin to configure the line ending. By default, used `\n`.

**New option**:
```yaml
# Logs plugin settings
logs:
    (....)
    # Line ending
    #
    # Default: "\n".
    line_ending: "\n"
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è HTTP [Access log support](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/34) at the `Info` log level.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:55555
  max_request_size: 1024
  access_logs: true <-------- Access Logs ON/OFF
  middleware: []

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```
- ‚úèÔ∏è HTTP middleware to handle `X-Sendfile` [header](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/issues/9).
  Middleware reads the file in 10MB chunks. So, for example for the 5Gb file, only 10MB of RSS will be used. If the file size is smaller than 10MB, the middleware fits the buffer to the file size.
```yaml
http:
  address: 127.0.0.1:44444
  max_request_size: 1024
  middleware: ["sendfile"] <----- NEW MIDDLEWARE

  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Service plugin now supports env variables passing to the script/executable/binary/any like in the `server` plugin:
```yaml
service:
  some_service_1:
    command: "php test_files/loop_env.php"
    process_num: 1
    exec_timeout: 5s # s,m,h (seconds, minutes, hours)
    remain_after_exit: true
    env:  <----------------- NEW
      foo: "BAR"
    restart_sec: 1
```

- ‚úèÔ∏è Server plugin can accept scripts (sh, bash, etc) in it's `command` configuration key:
```yaml
server:
    command: "./script.sh OR sh script.sh" <--- UPDATED
    relay: "pipes"
    relay_timeout: "20s"
```
The script should start a worker as the last command. For the `pipes`, scripts should not contain programs, which can close `stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr`.

- ‚úèÔ∏è Nats jobs driver support - [PR](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-plugins/pull/68).
```yaml
nats:
  addr: "demo.nats.io"

jobs:
  num_pollers: 10
  pipeline_size: 100000
  pool:
    num_workers: 10
    max_jobs: 0
    allocate_timeout: 60s
    destroy_timeout: 60s

  pipelines:
    test-1:
      driver: nats
      prefetch: 100
      subject: "default"
      stream: "foo"
      deliver_new: "true"
      rate_limit: 100
      delete_stream_on_stop: false
      delete_after_ack: false
      priority: 2

  consume: [ "test-1" ]
```
- Driver uses NATS JetStream API and is not compatible with non-js API.


- ‚úèÔ∏è Response API for the NATS, RabbitMQ, SQS and Beanstalk drivers. This means, that you'll be able to respond to a specified in the response queue.
  Limitations:
    - To send a response to the queue maintained by the RR, you should send it as a `Job` type. There are no limitations for the responses into the other queues (tubes, subjects).
    - Driver uses the same endpoint (address) to send the response as specified in the configuration.

## ü©π Fixes:

- üêõ Fix: local and global configuration parsing.
- üêõ Fix: `boltdb-jobs` connection left open after RPC close command.
- üêõ Fix: close `beanstalk` connection and release associated resources after pipeline stopped.
